 
1. compile bbfs.c as:
gcc bbfs.c -o bbfs `pkg-config fuse --cflags --libs`

2.in example folder, 
../src/bbfs rootdir mountdir

3. change to mountdir
4 .execute all commands. those will be reflected in the rootdir.
5.unmount.




////////////////////////////////////////////////
Now, if you go into the example directory and execute

    ../src/bbfs rootdir mountdir

all of the files that are really in rootdir appear to also be in mountdir"


    
But, every time you perform any file operation in mountdir, the operation (and a whole bunch of both relevant and irrelevant stuff) gets logged to a new file in the current working directory called bbfs.log If you execute

    tail -F bbfslog

in another terminal window, you can watch the operations get logged.

Finally, you can see that the operating system sees mountdir as a filesystem:


    snowball:660$ mount | grep mountdir
    bbfs on /home/joseph/fuse-tutorial/example/mountdir type fuse.bbfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1248,group_id=1005)

Unmounting

Finally, you can unmount the filesystem with

    snowball:661$ fusermount -u mountdir
    snowball:662$ ls -lR
    .:
    total 40
    -rw-r--r-- 1 joseph users   185 Jun  9 15:56 Makefile
    -rw-r--r-- 1 joseph users 27520 Jun 12 17:57 bbfs.log
    drwxr-xr-x 2 joseph users  4096 Jun 12 17:16 mountdir/
    drwxr-xr-x 2 joseph users  4096 Jun 12 17:16 rootdir/

    ./mountdir:
    total 0

    ./rootdir:
    total 4
    -rw-r--r-- 1 joseph users 11 Jun 12 17:16 bogus.txt

(note that fusermount isn't part of this tutorial â€” it comes along with FUSE).
